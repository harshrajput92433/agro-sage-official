## **1. Problem Statement**

Farming is the backbone of our food supply, but plant diseases continue to be a major challenge for farmers everywhere. Diseases often go unnoticed until it’s too late, mainly because expert diagnosis is not always accessible, and manual checks can be slow or inaccurate. As a result, farmers face reduced crop yields and financial losses.

**AgriSage Official** was created to make plant disease diagnosis faster, easier, and more accessible. By simply uploading an image of a leaf, the model can identify diseases with high accuracy—helping farmers make quick decisions and protect their crops.

## **2. Scope of the Project**

AgriSage Official focuses on simplifying plant health monitoring through intelligent automation. The project includes:

* Identifying diseases from plant leaf images using a trained deep learning model.
* Detecting healthy vs. diseased leaves across multiple plant types.
* Delivering fast and reliable predictions suitable for mobile and web use.
* Providing a model that is easy to integrate into real-world applications.
* Supporting students, researchers, and developers working in agri-tech.
